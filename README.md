problem_design :

       folder with the different conception of the classification problem in the thesis

thesis_regression_example :

       some little work on tropical curves and varities to get familiar with the tropical world
       
tropical_varieties_from_net: 

       work done on the different architectures trained on the classification problem, aiming at drawing the tropical varieties
