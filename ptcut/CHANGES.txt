PtCut v3.3.3 -- 2019-04-02

x Fixes and workarounds for Python 2.x, SageMath and Linux OS.  Now, PtCut has
  been tested under:

  -- Python 3.7.2 under Windows 8.1
  -- Python 3.7.1 under Windows 10 v1809
  -- Python 2.7.12 under Ubuntu 16.04
  -- Python 3.5.2 under Ubuntu 16.04
  -- SageMath 7.5.1 (Python 2.7.13) under Ubuntu 16.04

+ Computation of connected components is working again.  graph.py can be called
  on its own with the basename of individual .lp files or with the filename of
  a multi-lp file.

  Example: you have solutions saved in db\BIOMD0000000026\ep5-sol-*.lp:
    graph.py db\BIOMD0000000026\ep5-sol-

  Example: you have all solutions in db\BIOMD0000000026\ep5-solutions.txt:
    graph.py db\BIOMD0000000026\ep5-solutions.txt

+ Detect rational systems and multiply each equation by the lcm of its monomials.

- Run-time errors are now logged to file as well.
